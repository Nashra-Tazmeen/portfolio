[![OpenAI Logo](https://github.com/Nashra-Tazmeen/Stock-Price-Prediction-And-Forecasting-Using-Stacked-LSTM-/blob/main/Images/image2.jpeg?raw=true)](https://github.com/Nashra-Tazmeen/Stock-Price-Prediction-And-Forecasting-Using-Stacked-LSTM-)

Stock-Price-Prediction-And-Forecasting-Using-Stacked-LSTM" is a project where I utilized Stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to forecast stock prices. Leveraging LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), I developed a model capable of learning intricate patterns within historical stock price data. Through the stacking of multiple LSTM layers, the model effectively captured the complex temporal dependencies inherent in financial markets.

This project is dedicated to implementing Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for coherence score calculation, serving as the primary objective of the project.
he implementation follows a systematic approach, starting with data preprocessing and moving on to LDA model training and evaluation.

As we know security remained one of the top research areas in networking whether it is based on cloud computing or fog computing. Several researchers are focusing on detecting botnet attacks.

Here in this project, I have generated a botnet detection Ml model employing a sophisticated algorithm leveraging features and analysis through supervised learning techniques enabling it to identify potential Botnets with high accuracy.
