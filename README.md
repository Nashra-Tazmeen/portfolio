Stock-Price-Prediction-And-Forecasting-Using-Stacked-LSTM" is a project where I utilized Stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to forecast stock prices. Leveraging LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), I developed a model capable of learning intricate patterns within historical stock price data. Through the stacking of multiple LSTM layers, the model effectively captured the complex temporal dependencies inherent in financial markets.
